How to connect USB devices to WSL2 distribution running on Windows 10

# Intro

Using WSL2 on Windows 10 is nice but it does not support USB out of the box.

To do so you will need to recompile the Linux Kernel used by your WSL distro, install `usbipd` on your windows machine and grant your user admin rights.

## Create a new distro with USB/IP enabled

To do so follow the excellent guide from the USB/IP repo [here](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support#building-your-own-usbip-enabled-wsl-2-kernel).

* `<install-path>` can be any path on your PC, I've set it to my user home.
* `<user>` is the username used in your original SWL2 instance.

The new WSL2 distribution `wsl2-usbip` will have the kernel module to work with USB\IP.
**Note** that this distribution does not share data with the original distribution.

## Install USBIPd on windows 10

```
winget install usbipd
```

This should be enough. Check [dorssel/usbipd-win](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) for more info.

## Grant your user admin rights

If you are like me and your user does not have admin rights but you have access to an admin user do as follow:

Open a `powershell` with admin right
```
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "<GROUP>\<user.name>"
```

More info [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.localaccounts/add-localgroupmember?view=powershell-5.1).

## Connect USB to WSL distribution

Discover which USB device you can share with WSL2.

In `powershell` or `cmd`
```
C:\Program Files\usbipd-win> .\usbipd.exe wsl list

```

connect i.e `STM32 STLink` in `powershell` or `cmd` with admin rights (elevated)
```
.\usbipd.exe wsl attach --busid 11-4 --distribution  wsl2-usbip
```

in the WSL2 shell (`wsl2-usbip`) that you can ran with `wsl --distribution wsl2-usbip --user <user>`
